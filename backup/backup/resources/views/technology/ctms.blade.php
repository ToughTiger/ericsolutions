                A Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) is a software solution targeted for the Life
                Science industry. CTMS is commonly used to manage processes and
                large amounts of data involved with clinical trial management and clinical study management
            </p>
            <p class="service_offer">A typical CTMS maintains and manages the planning, preparation,
                performance, and reporting of clinical trials, with an emphasis on keeping up-to-date
                contact information for participants and tracking deadlines and milestones such as those for
                regulatory approval or the issue of progress reports. </p>
            <p class="service_offer">In some cases, a CTMS may also provide data to a business intelligence
                system, which acts as a digital dashboard for trial managers. </p>
