                            <h4>Why Do we need Data Standardization?</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>In 2013</strong>, FDA released Statement on the importance of standardized study
                                data and its positive impact on a “reviewer’s ability to more fully understand and
                                characterize the efficacy and safety of a medical product”. Following which towards
                                2014, the FDA finalized Binding Guidance documents that make submission of electronic
                                data mandatory, and also require the data to be in a standard format that the FDA can
                                process, review and archive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By the end of 2016, both the FDA and PMDA require CDISC standards for all submissions.
                                Eventually submissions that do not comply with the CDISC requirements after the
                                stipulated timeframe could potentially receive a Refusal to File (RTF) from the agency.
                                Thus, all studies that start in 2017 or later will be required to submit their data to
                                the FDA in an electronic format that uses CDISC data standards.

                        <p>We ensure there is an accurate interpretation of the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) and
                            Analysis Data Model (ADaM) that is identified, documented, managed, implemented
                            consistently, and most importantly, communicated to the Sponsor. We are well positioned to
                            execute CDISC – SDTM & ADaM conversion projects smoothly. We deliver all this through proper
