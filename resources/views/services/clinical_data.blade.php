                            <h4>Why Do we need Data Standardization?</h4>
                            <p>
                            In 2013, the FDA released a statement on the importance of standardized study data and its positive impact on a 'reviewer’s ability to more fully understand and characterize the efficacy and safety of a medical product'. Subsequently, in 2014, the FDA finalized binding guidance documents that make the submission of electronic data mandatory and require the data to be in a standard format that the FDA can process, review, and archive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            By the end of 2016, both the FDA and PMDA required CDISC standards for all submissions.
                            Submissions that do not comply with the CDISC requirements after the stipulated timeframe could potentially receive a Refusal to File (RTF) from the agency.
                            Therefore, all studies that started in 2017 or later are required to submit their data to the FDA in an electronic format that uses CDISC data standards.
                            </p>
