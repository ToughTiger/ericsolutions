                                    The electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) is an application which leverages software and server technology to guide and assist the setup, collection, storage, tracking and archival of essential clinical study documents.
                                </p>
                                <p>The Trial Master File (TMF) is a structured collection of documents for a clinical trial to show evidence of regulatory compliance, allowing the conduct and quality of data collection to be evaluated.  TMF contains study level, country level and site level documents, and those documents are collected at multiple points during the study (e.g. startup to study close).  A related feature set, the electronic Investigator Site File (eISF) portal, can work in conjunction with your eTMF to facilitate document exchange between sponsor/CRO and sites.</p>
